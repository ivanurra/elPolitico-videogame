This videogame was created as one of the three projects that must be submitted to finish the **Ironhack bootcamp**. Coded in solitary in five days, using the following technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The videogame is a tribute to those 8bit games from the 80s that I played when I was a child.
